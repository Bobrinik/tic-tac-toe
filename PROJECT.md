## [Project](https://github.com/Bobrinik/tic-tac-toe)

- Tic-tac-toe is an implementation of tic-tac-toe game in Clojure using Jupyter notebook.

## Project Difficulties

- It has been my first attempt in implementing tic-tac-toe in Clojure. The biggest difficulty was to find a reference project to see how the right solution has to look like so that I could learn and see how the "right way" is supposed to look.

## Solution

- Github has been a useful resource for this. I checked couple of implementations  in Clojure and Ocaml to give me a general sense of what components are needed and how to organise code in a functional style.

## Technology used

- Cojure
- Jupyter notebooks
